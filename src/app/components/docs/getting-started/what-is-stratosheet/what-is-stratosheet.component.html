    <h1>What is Stratosheet?</h1>
    <p>
      Stratosheet is a tool that allows users to manage their data using a
      spreadsheet-like interface, but backed by the power of a database.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows users to manipulate data in a familiar way while also being
      able to have powerful data validation and the ability to use that data to
      automate common tasks like emailing customers.

      <h1>Why use Stratosheet?</h1>
      <p>
        Spreadsheets are a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data, but
        they also have some limitations. Spreadsheets are particularly poor at:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="ml-2">
          <span class="font-bold">Validating data.</span>
          Spreadsheets have a very limited ability to prevent users from
          entering bad data.
        </li>
        <li class="ml-2">
          <span class="font-bold">Relationships.</span>
          Spreadsheets have no real way to relate one piece of data to another.
        </li>
        <li class="ml-2">
          <span class="font-bold">Tooling.</span>
          Generally, data in a spreadsheet is stuck in the spreadsheet. Though
          some spreadsheets offer add-ons, they are mostly focused on
          visualizations and are often expensive.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Stratosheet's goal is to solve for these shortcomings by providing
        robust data validation, support for defining relationships between
        different data points, and making it easy to use your data to interact
        with other tools you use.
