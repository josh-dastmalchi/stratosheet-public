<h1>Key Concepts</h1>

<h2>Workspaces</h2>
<p>
  Workspaces are containers for all your tables, external connections, and data.
  They are used to keep unrelated data separate and to let groups of people
  collaborate in different areas.
</p>

<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>
  Tables are where your data is stored. Just like a spreadsheet, each table has
  a set of columns, which define what data is stored, and rows, which are the
  individual records.
</p>
<p>
  Tables support having multiple views. Views allow you to customize how you see
  data from your tables. There are multiple kinds of views, which you can use to
  present subsets of your data or to visualize them in different ways.

<h2>Automations</h2>
<p>
  Automations are actions that are taken automatically in response to changes to
  your data. For example, an email can be sent whenever a new row is added to a
  table.
