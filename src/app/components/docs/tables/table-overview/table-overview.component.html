<h1>Tables Overview</h1>
<p>
  Tables are where your data is stored. Just like a spreadsheet, each table has
  a set of columns, which define what data is stored, and rows, which are the
  individual records.

    <h2>Columns</h2>
    <p>
      Columns define what kind of data is stored, and what kind of validation
      should be performed on the data.

    <h2>Rows</h2>
    <p>
      Each row in a table represents an individual record, and contains data
      based on the columns defined for the table.

    <h2>Display Format</h2>
    <p>
      There are some scenarios, like when referencing one row from or another,
      or viewing a row on the calendar or kanban views, where Stratosheet shows
      a short description of that row. The way that description is formatted can
      be configured using the table's Display Format.

    <h2>Actions</h2>
    <p>
      Each table has a system-defined Edit action, which is enabled by default.
      This action allows all columns in the row to be edited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tables can support any number of custom actions, which let you define your
      own use cases for changing the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, on a Customer table, you might define an action called
      'Update Address' that defines that only columns related to their address
      should be updated.
