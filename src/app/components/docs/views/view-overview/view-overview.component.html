<h1>Views</h1>
<p>
  Views allow you to customize how you see data from your tables. There are
  multiple kinds of views, which you can use to present subsets of your data or
  to visualize them in different ways.
</p>
<p>
  Each table can have any number of views, and each view must have a unique
  name.
</p>
<p>
  When a table is created, a default table view is automatically created, and
  cannot be removed.
</p>
<p>There are three types of views:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
  <li class="ml-2"><a routerLink="/docs/views/table">Table</a></li>
  <li class="ml-2"><a routerLink="/docs/views/table">Calendar</a></li>
  <li class="ml-2"><a routerLink="/docs/views/table">Kanban</a></li>
</ul>
