      <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>

      <p>
        Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or
        browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you
        visit our Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or
        navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific

        and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes. Like many
        businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar

          type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services
          (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and
          files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which

          precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the
          type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For
          example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation
          data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address).
          You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by
          refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location

      <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter

        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.

      <h6>Verification process</h6>

      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.
      </p>

      <h6>Other privacy rights</h6>

      <p>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</p>
      <p>
        You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or
        no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA
        on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does
        not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your
        behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your
        personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out
        request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but
        no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
